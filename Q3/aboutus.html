      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We are a small team of passionate designers and developers committed to delivering high-quality work.</p>
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to make the web accessible and meaningful for everyone.</p>
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>This studio started after noticing that many small businesses 
        were either overcharged for simple websites or stuck with outdated 
        designs that didn’t work well on mobile. We decided to offer clear pricing,
         honest communication, and websites that actually solve real 
         business problems.</p>
      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple and transparent pricing</li>
        <li>Clean, responsive designs</li>
        <li>Direct communication with the developer — no middlemen</li>
        <li>Focus on performance, not unnecessary features</li>
      </ul>
